  <p>I am fascinated by all things time-related and New Year's Eve was never the same again when I found out that "Happy New
    Year" is celebrated many times -- moving across the globe through the timezones.</p>
  <p>For obvious reasons our timekeeping is closely related to the sun. Without complicating matters further by taking timezones
    into account this app shows an approximization of day and night (and twilight) across the globe.</p>

  <p>This app owes most of its backend code to
    <a href="http://www.edesign.nl/2009/05/14/math-behind-a-world-sunlight-map/">J.P.Westerhof</a> who shares
    <a href="http://www.edesign.nl/examples/sunlightmap/map.php?show_source">PHP code</a> which was translated to Go.</p>
